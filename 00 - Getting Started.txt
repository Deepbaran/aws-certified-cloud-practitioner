AWS Global Infrastructure:
===========================
1. AWS Regions
---------------
- Regions are on a global scale.
- Regions have multiple zones.
- Region is a cluster of data centers. 
- AWS Services are region-scoped.
- AWS has Regions all over the world, named like us-east-1, eu-west-3, etc.

- To choose a AWS Region:
a. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without explicit permission.
b. Proximity to customers: reduced latency
c. Available service withing a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.
d. Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.

2. AWS Availability Zones
--------------------------
- Each region has many availability zones. (minimum is 3 and maximum is 6).
- Each availability Zones (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
- They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
