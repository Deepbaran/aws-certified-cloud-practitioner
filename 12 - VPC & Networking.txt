VPC & Networking:
----------------

VPC – Crash Course:
------------------
• VPC is something you should know in depth for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate & AWS Certified SysOps Administrator
• At the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Level, you should know about:
	• VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways
	• Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
	• VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
	• Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
	• Transit Gateway
• I will just give you an overview, less than 1 or 2 questions at your exam.
• We’ll have a look at the “default VPC” (created by default by AWS for you)
• There is a summary lecture at the end. It’s okay if you don’t understand it all

VPC & Subnets Primer:
--------------------
• VPC -Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
• Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
• A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
• A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
• To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways:
-------------------------------
• Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
• Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
• NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

Network ACL & Security Groups:
-----------------------------
• NACL (Network ACL)
	• A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
	• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	• Are attached at the Subnet level
	• Rules only include IP addresses
• Security Groups
	• A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
	• Can have only ALLOW rules
	• Rules include IP addresses and other security groups
	
Network ACLs vs Security Groups:
-------------------------------
- Security Groups

- Network ACL

VPC Flow Logs:
-------------
• Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	• VPC Flow Logs
	• Subnet Flow Logs
	• Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
• Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
	• Subnets to internet
	• Subnets to subnets
	• Internet to subnets
• Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc…
• VPC Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs

VPC Peering:
-----------
• Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network
• Make them behave as if they were in the same network
• Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
• VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

VPC Endpoints:
-------------
• Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
• This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
• VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
• VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services):
---------------------------------------
• Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPCs
• Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables…
• Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC)

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect:
---------------------------------
• Site to Site VPN
	• Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
	• The connection is automatically encrypted
	• Goes over the public internet
• Direct Connect (DX):
	• Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	• The connection is private, secure and fast
	• Goes over a private network
	• Takes at least a month to establish

Site-to-Site VPN:
----------------
• On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
• AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)

AWS Client VPN:
--------------
• Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
• Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP (just as if you were in the private VPC network)
• Goes over public Internet

Transit Gateway:
--------------- 
• For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
• One single Gateway to provide this functionality
• Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections

VPC Closing Comments:
--------------------
• VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
• Subnets:Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
• Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
• NAT Gateway / Instances: give internet access to private subnets
• NACL: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
• Security Groups: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
• VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, nontransitive

VPC Closing Comments:
--------------------
• VPC Endpoints: Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
• PrivateLink: Privately connect to a service in a 3rd party VPC
• VPC Flow Logs: network traffic logs
• Site to Site VPN: VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS
• Client VPN: OpenVPN connection from your computer into your VPC
• Direct Connect: direct private connection to AWS
• Transit Gateway: Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together
