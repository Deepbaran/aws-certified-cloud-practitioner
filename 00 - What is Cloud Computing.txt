What is Cloud Computing:
===========================

What is Cloud Computing?
-----------------------
• Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
• Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
• You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
• You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
• Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
• Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

You’ve been using some Cloud services:
-------------------------------------
• Gmail
	• E-mail cloud service
	• Pay for ONLY your emails stored (no infrastructure, etc.)
• Dropbox
	• Cloud Storage Service
	• Originally built on AWS
• Netflix
	• Built on AWS
	• Video on Demand

The Deployment Models of the Cloud:
----------------------------------
• Private Cloud:
	• Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
	• Complete control
	• Security for sensitive applications
	• Meet specific businessneeds
• Public Cloud:
	• Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
	• Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
• Hybrid Cloud:
	• Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
	• Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
	• Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud
	
The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
-------------------------------------------
• On-demand self service:
	• Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
• Broad network access:
	• Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
• Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
	• Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
	• Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
• Rapid elasticity and scalability:
	• Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
	• Quickly and easily scale based on demand
• Measured service:
	• Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
	
Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:
---------------------------------
• Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
	• Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
	• Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
• Benefit from massive economies of scale
	• Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
• Stop guessing capacity
	• Scale based on actual measured usage
• Increase speed and agility
• Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
• Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Problems solved by the Cloud:
----------------------------
• Flexibility: change resource types when needed
• Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
• Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
• Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
• High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
• Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

Types of Cloud Computing:
------------------------
• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	• Provide building blocks for cloud IT
	• Provides networking, computers, data storage space
	• Highest level of flexibility
	• Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
• Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	• Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
	• Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
• Software as a Service (SaaS)
	• Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
	
Managed By:
							On-premise			IaaS			PaaS		SaaS
							----------			----			----		----
		Applications			You				You				You			Others
		Data					You				You				You			Others
		Runtime					You				You				Others		Others
		Middleware				You				You				Others		Others
		O/S						You				You				Others		Others
		Virtualisation			You				Others			Others		Others
		Servers					You				Others			Others		Others
		Storage					You				Others			Others		Others
		Networking				You				Others			Others		Others
	
Example of Cloud Computing Types:
--------------------------------
 • Infrastructure as a Service: 
	• Amazon EC2 (on AWS) 
	• GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode 
• Platform as a Service: 
	• Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS) 
	• Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft) 
• Software as a Service: 
	• Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning) 
	• Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

Pricing of the Cloud – Quick Overview:
-------------------------------------
• AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
• Compute:
	• Pay for compute time
• Storage:
	• Pay for data stored in the Cloud
• Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
	• Data transfer IN is free
• Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

AWS Cloud Use Cases:
-------------------
• AWS enables you to build sophisticated, scalable applications
• Applicable to a diverse set of industries
• Use cases include
	• Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data analytics
	• Website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps
	• Gaming

AWS Global Infrastructure:
===========================
1. AWS Regions
---------------
- Regions are on a global scale.
- Regions have multiple zones.
- Region is a cluster of data centers. 
- AWS Services are region-scoped.
- AWS has Regions all over the world, named like us-east-1, eu-west-3, etc.
- AWS Regions are a cluster of data centers, and are geographical constructs composed of two or more Availability Zones.

- To choose a AWS Region:
a. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without explicit permission.
b. Proximity to customers: reduced latency
c. Available service withing a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.
d. Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.

2. AWS Availability Zones
--------------------------
- Each region has many availability zones. (minimum is 3 and maximum is 6).
- Each availability Zones (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
- They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
- Which Global Infrastructure identity is composed of one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and are used to deploy infrastructure? => AZ

3. AWS Data Centers

4. AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence
---------------------------------------------
- AWS has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & || Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries.
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency.

--------------------------------------------------------------
= AWS has Global Services:
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
2. Route 53 (DNS Service)
3. CloudFront (Content Delivery Network
4. WAF (Web Application Firewall)

= Most AWS Services are Region Scoped:
1. Amazon EC2 (Insfrastructure as a Service)
2. Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
3. Lambda (Function as a Service)
4. Rekognition (Software as a Service)

--------------------------------------------------------------

Shared Responsibility Model diagram:
-----------------------------------
CUSTOMER = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY IN THE CLOUD
	• Security
	• Data
	• OS
	• Network/Firewall Configuration
	• etc.

AWS = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY OF THE CLOUD
	• Infrastructure of the cloud
		• All the H/W
		• All the S/W
	• Internal Security

- In cloud practitioner exam it will be asked "what is your responsibility and what is the responsibility of the AWS?".

AWS Acceptable Use Policy:
-------------------------
• https://aws.amazon.com/aup/ 
• No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content 
• No Security Violations 
• No Network Abuse 
• No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse
